This is my Rock Paper Scissors game.

I used an enum class to define "ROCK", "PAPER" and "SCISSORS".

The class "UserInterface" handled all of the printing of the game.

"RPSLogic" which is contained in the same package as the enum class handles the logic of the game, such as adding on points and deciding 
the hand that the computer picks.

This game is my first project written in the Eclipse IDE.

Thanks for reading.
